# Sartify Shopkeeper Agent

This project implements a shopkeeper agent using the Swarm framework. The agent interacts with customers, analyzes stock images to detect available fruits, and handles orders by processing the customer's selection and calculating the total price.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Uses OCR to detect available fruits in a stock image.
- **Inventory Management**: The agent provides real-time stock availability based on the analyzed image.
- **Order Processing**: Allows customers to select items from available fruits, calculates the total price, and processes the order.
- **Sales Summary**: Generates a daily sales summary, including the total revenue and orders processed.
